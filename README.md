# Workout Tracker

## User Story

- As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Business Context

A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.

## Using Mongo and Heroku

In order deploy an application with a MongoDB database to Heroku, I set up a MongoDB Atlas account and connect a database from there to your application.
